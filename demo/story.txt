Matra, 55, lives in a camp for displaced people in north-west Syria. Gardening reminds her of her village, and it helps her to forget her sorrow, fears and the conflict unfolding around her. In the winter, the smell of flowers from her garden gives her neighbours in the camp a much-needed respite from the smell of coal.
